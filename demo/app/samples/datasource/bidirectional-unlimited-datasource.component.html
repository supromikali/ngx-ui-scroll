    <p>
      The datasource implemented here has no boundaries.
      The result <em>data</em> array will consist of <em>count</em> items
      started from <em>index</em> position regardless of
      <em>count</em> and <em>index</em> values.
      They could be any finite integers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sample as well as following ones include <em>Datasource.get</em> log
      which tells us how many items are being fetched by the <em>uiScroll</em>
      via <em>Datasource</em>.
