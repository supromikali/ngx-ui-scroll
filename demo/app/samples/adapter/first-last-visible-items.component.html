    <p>
      The <em>Adapter</em> has two read-only properties
      which allow to determine the first and the last visible items:
      <em>firstVisible</em> and <em>lastVisible</em>.
      These are the objects of special <em>ItemAdapter</em> type
    </p>
    <pre>{{itemAdapterDescription}}</pre>
    <p>
      <em>$index</em> corresponds to <em>Datasource</em> item index value;
      <em>data</em> is what we were pushing to the <em>uiScroll</em>
      on <em>Datasource.get</em> (item's content);
      <em>element</em> is the DOM element that is relevant to our item.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to scalar <em>firstVisible</em> and <em>lastVisible</em> properties
      there are also Observable versions: <em>firstVisible$</em> and <em>lastVisible$</em>.
      Both versions could be used in the template as it is shown in this demo.
      Also, we may have appropriate subscriptions and
      here in this sample we are calculating
      a number of visible items with the help of <em>combineLatest</em> RxJs method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recalculation of the first and the last items occurs per each non-empty
      <em>Datasource.get</em> call after new items are retrieved and rendered
      and unnecessary items are clipped out.
    </p>
  </div>
