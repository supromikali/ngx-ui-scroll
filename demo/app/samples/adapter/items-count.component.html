    The uiScroll buffer has {{datasource.adapter.itemsCount}} items.
  </div>
  <div description>
    <p>
      We may use <em>Adapter.itemsCount</em> read-only property to see
      how many items exist in the <em>uiScroll</em> buffer at the moment.
      The <em>itemsCount</em> value is the same as the value of DOM elements counter.
