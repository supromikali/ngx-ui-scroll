    <p>
      The <em>uiScroll</em> might work in "infinite" mode, when items are never removed.
      This mode can be turned on via <em>infinite</em> property of the <em>settings</em> object.
      Setting <em>infinite</em> to true, we ask the <em>uiScroll</em>
      not to remove items that are getting out of the visible part of the viewport.
      That's why the DOM elements counter value is being increased per each edge-scroll event
      and never decreased.
