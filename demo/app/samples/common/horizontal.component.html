    <p>
      Horizontal scrolling could be enabled via <em>horizontal</em> setting. The styles also need to be fixed in
      accordance with horizontal scrolling. Currently we have some limitations at the template layer but
      <em>display: inline-block;</em> rule applied to all nested containers makes the horizontal mode work.
