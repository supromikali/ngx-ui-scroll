    <p>
      Here we set <em>bufferSize</em> property which defines minimal number of items
      that the <em>uiScroll</em> may retrieve via <em>Datasource.get</em> method in a single request.
      In this demo we see that the initial load consists of 2 requests of 15 items (from 1 to 15 and from -14 to 0).
      Initially the <em>uiScroll</em> starts fill the viewport downward from zero scroll position.
      If the first fetch is enough, the second one will be in the backward direction.
      The size of these fetches is determined by the <em>bufferSize</em> setting.
      The next fetches (during scrolling) could ask for more than <em>bufferSize</em> items,
      but never less than <em>bufferSize</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bigger the <em>bufferSize</em> value is, the less requests generally are needed
      to fill out the viewport.
      For example, scrolling from 1 to 100 item when the <em>bufferSize</em> is 1,
      we may get about 40 <em>Datasource.get</em> calls (depends on the environment).
      But this demo (where <em>bufferSize</em> is 15) shows that
      reaching 100 item would cost about 10 <em>Datasource.get</em> calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default value of <em>bufferSize</em> property is 5.
      It has to be a positive integer.
      The minimum value is 1.
