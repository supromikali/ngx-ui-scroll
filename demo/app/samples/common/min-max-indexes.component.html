    <p>
      If the boundaries of the data set are known,
      we may virtualize all the data items right on the <em>uiScroll</em> initialization, in other words
      the <em>uiScroll</em> will maintain forward and backward padding elements of the viewport
      in assumption that the data set consists of (maxIndex - minIndex) items.
      So it will be possible to jump to any position immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this demo we are telling the <em>uiScroll</em>
      to work with indexes in-between [1..1000] range only.
      1000 items per 25px give us 25000px,
      it is our viewport scrollable size and it will not be changed.
      Also, we may reach the bottom item in a single long scroll with just a couple of fetches:
      3-10 <em>Datasource.get</em> method calls against 70-200 ones in the previous demos.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important note is that <em>minIndex</em> and <em>maxIndex</em>
      should stay within the real datasource boundaries.
      All the demos we discussed before have unlimited datasources,
      so <em>minIndex</em> and <em>maxIndex</em> could accept any values.
      But in case the datasource is limited, say, by [MIN..MAX] range, then
      <em>minIndex</em> should be >= <em>MIN</em> and
      <em>maxIndex</em> should be <= <em>MAX</em>.
      An example of limited <em>Datasource.get</em> implementation can be found
      <a href="/#/datasource#limited">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>uiScroll</em> can accept only one of min/max indexes settings.
      For example, if we know that our datasource have no negative values,
      then we may define <em>minIndex</em> as 1 (or 0) and not define <em>maxIndex</em>.
      It also seems right idea to set <em>startIndex</em> value to 0 in case
      <em>minIndex</em> value had been set to 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of <em>minIndex</em> and <em>maxIndex</em> values should be integer.
      The default <em>minIndex</em> value is <em>-Infinity</em>.
      The default <em>maxIndex</em> value is <em>+Infinity</em>.
    </p>
